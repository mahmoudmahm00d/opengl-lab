- drwa traingle : half of it is red, the other half is white
- gluLookAt : draw two circles with two colors, one behind the other, use lookAt to look at the two on mouse click..
- rotate / heart - pump in place
- draw circle with 3 params : cx, cy, radius
- draw 2 circles(one is fixed and the other is rotating arround the first)
